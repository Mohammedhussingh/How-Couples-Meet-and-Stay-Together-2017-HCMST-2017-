# How Couples Meet and Stay Together (HCMST) Clustering Project

## Overview

This repository contains a project analyzing the "How Couples Meet and Stay Together" (HCMST) dataset using clustering techniques. The study is a nationally representative survey that examines how American adults form and maintain romantic relationships. The project aims to explore patterns within the dataset through clustering methods such as KMeans and KPrototypes.

Project Objectives

Understand relationship formation trends based on survey responses.

Identify meaningful clusters within the dataset to categorize different relationship dynamics.

Improve clustering accuracy through data preprocessing and feature engineering.

Provide insights into modern dating behaviors based on survey findings.

## Dataset

The dataset includes demographic, social, and relational factors related to couples.

It contains both numerical and categorical variables, requiring hybrid clustering approaches.

Methodology

## Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing numerical features.

## Clustering Models

Implementing KMeans for numerical data and KPrototypes for mixed-type data.

Evaluating clusters using performance metrics such as silhouette score.

## Insights & Interpretations

Analyzing the identified clusters to understand different relationship dynamics.
